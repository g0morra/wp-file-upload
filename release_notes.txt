<span><strong>Latest release notes: </strong>This version makes the plugin easier, even for people that do not have knowledge on how to use shortcodes. A button has been added in Plugin Instances below that can be used to add the plugin to a page or post quickly. What it does is that it inserts the plugin's shortcode at the beginning of the selected page or post. Furthermore, a bug was corrected where administrators could not open the Shortcode Composer or they could not see the plugin instance they created. This problem happened when the shortcode was added inside another shortcode or with some visual page editors.</span>
