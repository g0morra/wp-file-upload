It replaces the action wfu_after_file_upload that existed for the same reason, however through the filter javascript code can be defined that will be executed at the client's browser after each file is uploaded.<br />This version introduces also a new option in Settings to select the POST method. This options resolves errors like <em>"http:// wrapper is disabled in the server configuration by allow_url_fopen"</em> or <em>"Call to undefined function curl_init()"</em> that may appear in some server environments.<br />In addition, Serbian translation was added thanks to Andrijana Nikolic from </span><a href="http://webhostinggeeks.com">webhostinggeeks</a><span>. </span><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Translations in other languages are more than welcome!</strong></span>
